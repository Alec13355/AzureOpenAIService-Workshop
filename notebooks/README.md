# Self-Guided Learning - With Notebooks

Want to do this workshop on your own? You have some options:
- Get an OpenAI account and use the [OpenAI Playground](https://platform.openai.com/playground)
- Get an Azure OpenAI account and use the [Azure OpenAI Portal](https://oai.azure.com/portal) to access that Playground
- Use the OpenAI or Azure OpenAI API key to run through the same exercises, in a Jupyter notebook.

This folder will be updated with Jupyter Notebook versions of the exercises, with instructions to help you get started.
